# Star Blazer (original Python3 version)

I'm mostly uploading this for the 1st year students who are curious to 
see my code.

Star Blazer was my summer 2016 school project, and also my first 
"complete" video game, even if it's really primitive by today's 
standards. It is essentially a journey through the wonderful world of 
finite state machines.

The code should be clear enough (thanks to the power of comments), but 
in retrospect, I find it highly unstructured. The "import cascade" in 
particular is very hacky in hindsight, though back then I did not know 
better.

Even though it's very stable at the end of the day, I still hope that I 
improved since I made this game...

# Dependencies

IIRC it only depends on PyGame. I used to package it using PyInstaller, 
but that isn't really required, unless you want to use it on a machine 
that does not have Python3 and PyGame already installed.
